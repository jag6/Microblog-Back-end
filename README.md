# Microblog-Back-end APIs

## Description
This is a back-end for a microblogging app. APIs cover all CRUD functionality for users, posts, comments, tags, likes, and following. Nested serializations can be displayed and tweaked by either adding '?expand=' with the desired field after the equals sign (eg., ?expand=comments), or 'omit?=' with the desired field after the = sign. Users are token authenticated.
